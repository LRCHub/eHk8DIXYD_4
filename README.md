[00:04.73] I think I did it again
[00:06.96] I can't stop looking at you
[00:09.44] Oh, why?
[00:13.80] When you get closer to me
[00:16.26] With such a lovely smile
[00:18.57] Oh, my
[00:21.57] 
[00:22.61] You make me so much hyped up
[00:24.68] Like when I had too much caffeine
[00:27.35] Everything feels so good
[00:28.91] My heart beats so fast, but I don't care
[00:32.13] I'm into you, baby
[00:34.62] I know what to say
[00:36.47] Don't wanna hold it back
[00:38.29] I'm gonna tell you
[00:47.29] 
[00:41.29] I like you
[00:43.49] More than just a friend
[00:45.92] Crush on you
[00:48.03] So be mine
[00:49.88] (I really like)
[00:50.85] For you

[01:14.07] Why do you look at me like that?
[01:16.06] 'Cause you will get my mind go all blank

[01:20.41] Feels like I am on the cloud nine
[01:36.91] 
[01:22.75] You and I
[01:23.50] Every day and night
[01:25.08] We're texting like signal
[01:27.36] You call me
[01:27.98] Just to say random things
[01:29.94] On the weekends, boy
[01:32.08] We're into each other
[01:34.62] You know what I'd say
[01:36.45] Don't need to hold it back
[01:38.26] Want you to tell me

[02:07.38] 
[02:00.85] Wishing upon a twinkle star
[02:03.93] Shining and glittering lights
[02:07.03] Just like my heart
[02:08.88] I don't need explanations
[02:11.75] No fancy words
[02:13.55] Just gonna tell you that I
[02:16.17] I really, really like you
[02:28.67]
